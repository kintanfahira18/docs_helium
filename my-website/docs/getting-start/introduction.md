Thank you for choosing Helium! We're so excited for you to join our amazing user community. This documentation is a complete guide that will guide you through everything Helium has to offer.

## Helium Features Are Available to You!

### Continuous Monitoring

### Scan with VAPT Tools
All the tools are available for you to scan the Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Infrastructure and Encryption. The tools can perform Scan in background, so you can sleep well.

### Schedule your scans
Schedule your scans and periodically evaluate your systems for the vulnerabilities. You can set them up to run once, daily, weekly, or monthly at a specific date and time.

### Parallel & Bulk Scanning
We provided you a parallel scan. You can scan a lot of targets at one time. You can also select multiple targets that you want to scan and run a scanner against them.

### Keep history of your scans
Having a history of your scans allows you to see how the security of your targets has evolved. You can compare old results with new ones and see what has changed. You also can choose to export the scans history.

### Discover your attack surface
Automatically detect open ports, services, and running software from all of your targets. The Attack Surface pulls results from scanners to give you an overview of your targets.

### Workspaces
Workspace allows you to organize your targets based on the project that you're working at, the client name, etc. All the works that you are doing goes into the current workspace. You also can move targets between workspaces and delete them if they are no longer necessary.

### Manage Team
Working with the team to collaborate and deliver better security assessment. You can also see the team activity log.

### Mobile Apps Scanner
Mobile Static Application Security Testing allows you to do a static analysis in mobile apps. It covers iOS and Android apps. So, you don't have to install a lot of mobile pentest tools. This will save your time from installation and configuration.

### Slack and Telegram Integrations
You can do a Scan via Telegram/Slack until you get a notification of the scan results, you can do it anywhere without bringing a computer.

### API Access
The API allows you to integrate our platform with your tools and internal workflows. For instance, you can trigger automatic scans whenever you deploy a new website, or you make a change in your application. Furthermore, you can develop your own tools based on our scanning engines.

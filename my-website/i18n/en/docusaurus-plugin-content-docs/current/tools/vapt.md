Users can access the tools via the navigation menu by clicking on "VAPT Tools". If the user chooses to perform scanning via the navigation menu, then the user must enter the required target values. This is different from scanning via the targets page because the target value is entered at the beginning when adding the target. Once the scanning process is complete, users will receive a notification via email, and if they have integrated with Telegram or Slack, they will also receive notifications via both platforms.
